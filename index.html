                        The Java Certification course you completed at Infosys provided a thorough understanding of both basic and advanced Java programming concepts. It covered essential topics such as Java syntax, control structures, and data types, followed by Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Additionally, the course explored core concepts like arrays, strings, and exception handling, while also diving into advanced topics such as the Collections Framework, multithreading, Java I/O, and generics. You also gained exposure to modern Java features like lambda expressions and streams from Java 8, and database connectivity using JDBC for working with relational databases. The course emphasized best practices in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code, and may have introduced design patterns and GUI development with JavaFX or Swing.</p>
